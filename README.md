This is a fresh and updated take on Harry Potter's School (Hogwarts-CRM). 

I don't know much about Harry Potter, but I do know this Webpage I designed and implemented in React JS for Front End and Python/Flask for BackEnd, is Beautiful!

Clone it... open it up in Visual Studio code (localhost 3000), open it in Pycharm (localhost 5000) and enjoy the ride!

Good luck and Be well...
